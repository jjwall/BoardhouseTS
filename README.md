# BoardhouseTS
This is game framework / scaffolding written in TypeScript for my own personal use to rapidly develop prototypes. It may or may not include the following:

* PixiJS rendering library (maybe write my own WebGL 2.0 rendering engine later on)
* React-like virtual DOM for UI components
* Event pump for updating and rendering game objects
* State system for managing menu / game / scene states
* Entity-component framework bundled with the following built-in components: position, texture, collision
* Tile-based level editor
* Simple animation engine
